# AMBA-AHB-Protocol
The Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) protocol is a widely used on-chip bus protocol in the field of digital electronics and computer architecture. It is part of the Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) developed by ARM Holdings. The AHB protocol is designed to facilitate efficient communication between different components, such as microprocessors, memory modules, and peripheral devices, within a system-on-chip (SoC) or a microcontroller. The AHB protocol provides a set of rules and guidelines that define how data and control signals are transferred between the master and slave devices connected to the bus. It establishes a standardized interface that allows for the interconnection and communication of various IP (intellectual property) blocks within a system, promoting compatibility and interoperability.
